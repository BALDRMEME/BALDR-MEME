One of the strange thing in crypto is that the 300 billions lottery market isn't addressed at the moment.

A Dapp that can permit to play in a transparent way to lotteries from your phone anywhere on the planet.

Multiples lotteries or betting markets with differents prizes and sizes, like winning the latest iPhone

or the Cybertruck... With on chain verified random numbers and a 80~90% redistribution.

Nobody is offering this at the moment.
